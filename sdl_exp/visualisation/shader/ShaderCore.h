 * This class is is a wrapper for the core OpenGL shader operations
 * Uniforms, textures and buffers can be automatically bound using the addXXX() methods, so they are provided to the shader
 * Subclasses may implement additional bindings
 * Bound items will then be automatically rebound when the shader is reloaded
 * Bound dynamic uniforms will automatically refresh the value everytime useProgram() is called
 *
 * This class is great for quickly using shaders, if you start double binding/unbinding stuff you might find bugs though
